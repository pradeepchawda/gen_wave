* Discription

The gen_wave.py is used to generate waveform based on memory data file and signal description file.

* Memory data file

The memory data file is expected to be in hex, and each data is 32/64/128/256 bit width, by default 64. You can also get one demo memory data, using the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python gen_wave.py debug -gm mem_data.txt
#+END_SRC

* Signal description file

The signal description file is given which is named signals.txt as an example.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python gen_wave.py gen -im mem_data.txt -is signals.txt -o gen.fsdb
#+END_SRC

* Dependencies

Based on Python version 2.7.13. Thanks to [[https://github.com/SanDisk-Open-Source/pyvcd][PyVCD]]. Please refer file requirements for other details.
